In this lesson, we'll learn how to count numbers from 1 all the way to 100! Counting is one of the most important math skills you'll learn.`},{type:"video",source:"youtube",title:"Counting to 100",url:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TgLtF3PMOc",description:"A fun video showing how to count from 1 to 100"},{type:"text",content:`## Counting by Ones

When we count by ones, we say each number in order:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and so on.

Notice the pattern as we count:
- After 9 comes 10
- After 19 comes 20
- After 29 comes 30

Each time we reach a 9, the next number starts a new group of ten!`},{type:"interactive",component:"NumberLine",props:{start:1,end:20,highlightEvery:1,interactive:!0}},{type:"text",content:`## Counting by Tens

We can also count by tens, which means we skip nine numbers each time:

10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100

This is a faster way to count to 100!`},{type:"interactive",component:"NumberLine",props:{start:0,end:100,highlightEvery:10,interactive:!0}},{type:"text",content:`## Writing Numbers

Remember that each number has its own symbol:
- 1 is written as '1'
- 10 is written as '10'
- 100 is written as '100'

When we write two-digit numbers like 42, the '4' tells us how many tens (4 tens = 40) and the '2' tells us how many ones (2 ones = 2).

So 42 = 40 + 2`},{type:"conclusion",content:"Great job learning to count to 100!
